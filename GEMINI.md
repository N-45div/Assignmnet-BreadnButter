You can submit:
Fully functional deployed application showcasing your work, OR
GitHub repo or ZIP with the source code and ReadMe. 
Preferred Add-ons:
A short written proposal outlining task(s) selected, your approach & architecture, tech stack used, AI/LLM use (if any), how you'd take this feature to prod as a founder. 
Documentation: PRDs, technical spec docs etc.
API docs or Postman Collection
Diagram, flowcharts, thoughts, idea etc.

Not expected: pixel-perfect UI or deep infra work ‚Äî this is to assess ownership, thinking, and creative engineering.
üí° Using LLMs, embeddings, or computer vision is totally optional. You can just write smart logic or workflows. We‚Äôre more interested in your product brain than your prompt game.
üîÄ Notes & Flexibility
Frontend-only? Great ‚Äî design just the matchmaking UI (Project 01), or the Talent Onboarding UI (Project 02) or the Dashboard & Comms Portal UI (Project 03).
Backend-only? Perfect ‚Äî just build and document the logic + endpoints.
Coding not your skill? No worries, take these problem statements and share your thoughts/solutions/ideas as a presentation/reports anyhow. We are listening!
AI not your strength? No worries. You can skip AI and focus on rules, logic, or product design.
Want to only do 20%? Totally okay ‚Äî just focus on one slice that shows your best self.
